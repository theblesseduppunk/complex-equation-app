    ### What does this equation solve?

    Our equation quantifies **complexity (C)** — a measure of how intricate or rich a system or experience is — by combining multiple meaningful factors:

    - **Reality magnitude (R):** The scale or intensity of the system under study  
    - **Cognitive and sensory parameters:** Attention, memory, sensory processing, emotional engagement, and quality — capturing how information is perceived and processed  
    - **Higher-dimensional space (Dₙ):** Accounting for abstract or extended dimensions that influence complexity  
    - **Nonlinear scaling factors:** Exponents that describe how different components interact and amplify effects  

    By mathematically linking these, the equation models how changes in any parameter affect the overall complexity.

    ### What does the app do?

    - Offers a **dynamic, interactive environment** to experiment with the equation in real time  
    - Lets users **adjust parameters** like attention or sensory input via intuitive controls  
    - Provides **immediate feedback** by recalculating complexity and updating visualizations  
    - Bridges theory and practice by making an abstract concept **accessible and engaging**  
    - Acts as a **tool for researchers, educators, and curious minds** exploring consciousness, cognition, AI, and complex systems  

    ### Why is this important?

    - Transforms a complex scientific model into a **hands-on exploration platform**  
    - Enables **“what-if” scenarios** to deepen understanding of how various factors contribute to complexity  
    - Opens avenues for **collaborations across neuroscience, philosophy, AI, and education**  
    - Sparks innovation by providing a **new way to conceptualize and work with complexity**

    *This app is a collaborative creation between human ingenuity and AI, demonstrating the power of partnership in advancing understanding.*

# Example: Call show_about() somewhere in your app flow, or make a sidebar button:
if st.sidebar.button("About"):
    show_about()
