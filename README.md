# The Complex Equation Simulator

This is an interactive Streamlit app to explore the Complex Equation model relating attention, memory, sensory input, and higher-dimensional space to complexity (C).

## Features

- Adjustable sliders for key parameters: Attention (A), Memory (M), Sensory Processing (S), Higher-Dimensional Space (Dâ‚™)  
- Live calculation of complexity \(C\) based on your inputs  
- Simple, intuitive interface built with Streamlit
